Experimental hybrid structures
=====

with printed framework and oogoo fill.

The idea is to use a quick-to-print framework and fill it with oogoo, thereby creating a hybrid structure which is quick to make, cheap (oogoo is factor 5 to 10 cheaper than filament) and still usable for large structures. The framework serves a dual purpose as a mold for the oogoo.
